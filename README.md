# Afternoon Workshop Guide
Between Personals and Groups we have two free afternoons open for mentor-led workshops and for competencies. These afternoons are relaxed and it's mostly up to the student how they spend their time. The workshops are a really cool opportunity for mentors to dive deeper on a few concepts that don't fit into our core curriculum and a really good tool to fight the burnout mindset that usually affects students during this part of the schedule.

## General Tips
The success of these two weeks between projects is directly tied to your attitude, even more than usual. Students have been pushing themselves really hard and as you probably know it's very easy to check out at this point. So let them know you're excited to teach the workshops, and you're really interested in the topics being taught in lectures. If you're checked out, they will check out. 

While announcing the workshops, we have found it helpful to talk about how these two weeks, and the workshops specifically are an excellent opportunity to learn the things they've been curious about, but haven't had the time to learn while laser-focused on their personal projects. 
When they leave DevMountain they will be in charge of pushing themselves to continue learning code, so getting that habit started now will help them when they graduate. 

It is also an excellent opportunity for any students that feel behind on the competencies to get caught up. 

## Topics
Good workshop topics typically fall into two groups and we suggest including some of both. The first is new concepts, such as libraries they haven't learned or cool new features of the languages they already know (like css grid). The second is going deeper on what they have already learned/best practices. 

We suggest sending a survey to the students asking for two new concepts and two review topics they would like to see workshops on. 

Tip: When choosing topics, keep in mind that the students are about to move to group projects, so try to choose topics that will be most beneficial for that. A crash course in Vue.js would be fun, but a workshop on planning or a library they might actually use in their projects may be better choices. 

### Suggestions for New Workshops
* CSS grid
* Design principles 
* Wireframing tools
* Libraries by popular vote (ex. socket.io, chartjs etc)

### Suggestions for Review Workshops
* Planning (timeboxing, updating plans, good resources)
* File structure/Component structure
* Dry code in React (functional components vs class components)
* Life cycle hooks
* Optimization

## Schedule 
The exact schedule you decide on will depend on your cohort. Variables to keep in mind are the number of students you have and how well they engage in large groups. 
No matter what schedule you decide on, allow for some short breaks between (15 min. seems to be a good length). It is also wise to follow a new concept workshop with a review workshop or vice versa to prevent overloading the students with completely new concepts. Also if you have a workshop that will run long pair it with a shorter workshop to help avoid fatigue. 

### Competencies
If the student would like to work on comptencies during these afternoons that is an option. When you decide how to split the workshops up between the mentors you should plan on having a mentor free at all times to help with either demo or assessment type competencies.

### Workshop Division
* 4 Mentors - Each mentor should take a class
* 3 Mentors - Each mentor should take a class. If you want to have four workshops one mentor will double up or you may be able to grab one of the other mentors if you desire their expertise
* 2 Mentors - Each mentor should take at least one class, or both double up to fill the schedule

### Examples
26 Students
* Four workshops total, taught by four mentors
* 2 new concepts, 2 review
* All four classes taught on Tue and again on Wed. Two taught from 1:45-2:45, and two taught from 3-4. This schedule allows students to attend two workshops the first afternoon and then rotate and attend the other two the next day.
* This allowed for smaller groups in the workshops which can be very benefitial with such a large cohort

14 Students
* Three workshops total, taught by three mentors
* 3 new concepts
* Two workshops taught Tue and one taught Wed. No repeating or rotating necessary with this small and vocal group
